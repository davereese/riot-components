# Riot Components
Just playing around with something new. See the components in action here: [https://codepen.io/davereese/project/full/DPgMjA/]: https://codepen.io/davereese/project/full/DPgMjA/

## Riot.js Starter Kit
Small starter kit to help speedup the development of a new Riot.js project.
It has lightserver to run the server, karma-mocha-chai as test framework,
index page with all dependencies, an app riot tag and an app-spec mocha test.


Clone, install and run
```
npm install
npm start //to run the dev server
npm test  //to run the specs
```

Then go to localhost:4000
